1. **Multi-modal Integration**: Combine insights from images, videos, and text descriptions
2. **Consistency Check**: Ensure room counts, appliances, and features align across modalities
3. **Professional Language**: Use real estate industry terminology

5. **Completeness**: Fill all fields; use appropriate "not available/specified" phrases when data is missing

## Edge Case Handling

- **Conflicting Information**: Use most recent or detailed source
- **Missing Data**: Use appropriate placeholder phrases, don't leave fields empty
- **Unclear Details**: Use general terms rather than guessing specifics
- **Multiple Properties**: Create separate JSON objects for each distinct property
- **Incomplete Information**: Mark clearly as "Information not available" rather than omitting

## Output Requirements

- **JSON ONLY** - no explanatory text, markdown formatting, or additional content
- Valid JSON syntax with proper escaping
- Natural, professional language throughout
- No redundant or duplicate information across fields
- Consistent formatting and terminology
